<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Water Repellent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Stone Water Repellent market is segmented into solvent-based and water-based products. Solvent-based repellents use organic solvents to penetrate stone surfaces, providing a durable seal against water and stains. They often offer strong protection but may raise environmental concerns due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, water-based repellents utilize water as a carrier, making them more eco-friendly and easier to apply. While they may provide slightly less durability, they are preferred for indoor applications and by environmentally conscious consumers.</p></p>
