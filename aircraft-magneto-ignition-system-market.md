<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Magneto Ignition System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Tension Ignition Systems</li><li>Low-Tension Ignition Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft magneto ignition system market is primarily divided into two types: high-tension and low-tension ignition systems. High-tension ignition systems generate high voltage directly at the magneto, delivering power to the spark plugs through insulated wires, ensuring effective ignition even under varied conditions. In contrast, low-tension ignition systems produce lower voltage and utilize an external coil to amplify the electrical spark before it reaches the spark plugs. Each system offers distinct advantages, tailored for specific aircraft engine requirements and performance needs.</p></p>
