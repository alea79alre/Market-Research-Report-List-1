<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Surgery Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Valves</li><li>TAVR Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The open surgery heart valves market primarily consists of mechanical valves and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) valves. Mechanical valves are durable, designed for long-term use, and require lifelong anticoagulation therapy. They are ideal for younger patients. In contrast, TAVR valves are minimally invasive, allowing for quicker recovery times and less postoperative discomfort. TAVR is often preferred for older patients or those with high surgical risks, facilitating effective treatment for aortic stenosis without traditional open-heart surgery.</p></p>
