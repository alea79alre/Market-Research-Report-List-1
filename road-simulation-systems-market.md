<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Simulation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spindle-Coupled Road Simulators</li><li>Tire-Coupled Road Simulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road simulation systems are crucial for automotive testing and research, divided mainly into two types: spindle-coupled and tire-coupled road simulators. Spindle-coupled road simulators connect directly to the vehicle's wheel hub, allowing precise control over dynamics and feedback. In contrast, tire-coupled road simulators utilize actual tires, simulating real-road conditions more accurately. Both types enable engineers to evaluate vehicle performance, handling, and comfort in controlled environments, enhancing development efficiency and safety in automotive engineering.</p></p>
